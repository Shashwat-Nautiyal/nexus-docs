# Getting started with the Avail Nexus SDK

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** We built a Next.js demo app that uses the Avail Nexus SDK to implement a unified Web3 experience.

1. You can use the app here: [avail-nexus-demo-five.vercel.app](https://avail-nexus-demo-five.vercel.app/)
2. You can find the code for the app here: [availproject/avail-nexus-demo](https://github.com/availproject/avail-nexus-demo).
</Callout>


There's a few simple steps to get started with the Avail Nexus SDK in your web app.

<Steps>

### Make sure your web app has an injected wallet provider

Any EIP-1193 provider works (MetaMask, WalletConnect v2, etc.).

### Initialize the SDK

You need to initialize the SDK with the wallet provider by calling the `.initialize()` method.
The app must use this method before any other SDK methods are called.

<Callout type="info">
**FOR EXAMPLE:**

1. the Avail demo app loads the `<Web3Provider>` component before anything else in the [layout.tsx](https://github.com/availproject/avail-nexus-demo/blob/main/src/app/layout.tsx#L33) file.
2. When a wallet is connected,`<Web3Provider>` flips `isConnected` to `true` and is passed down as a prop to `NexusProvider`.
3. [NexusProvider](https://github.com/availproject/avail-nexus-demo/blob/main/src/provider/NexusProvider.tsx) in turn initializes the SDK by calling `sdk.initialize(window.ethereum)`.
</Callout>

### Fetch balances

To test if your app has been able to set up the SDK correctly, try calling the `getUnifiedBalances()` method.

Here is an example of how to do that:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="Typescript"
const balances = await sdk.getUnifiedBalances();
console.log('All balances:', balances);
```

> You can also refer to the [UnifiedBalanceResponse](https://github.com/availproject/avail-nexus-demo/blob/main/src/components/unified-balance.tsx) 
component's implementation for further reference.

</Steps>

<summary>What do we mean by "unified balance"?</summary>

Unified balance shows all the liquidity in a user's EOA account across multiple chains in one view. It lets users transact seamlessly on any chain without needing bridges or pre-provisioning gas for token swaps. Chain abstraction handles all the complexity involved in a cross-chain transaction while enabling better UX through a single intent approval.

For instance, let us take the case where a user intends to spend 18 USDC on Scroll and does not have any balance on Scroll.

- Optimism: 0.1 ETH, O USDT, 0 USDC
- Arbitrum: 0 ETH, 12 USDT, 0 USDC
- Base: 0 ETH, 10 USDT, 0 USDC
- Scroll: 0 ETH, 0 USDT, 0 USDC

To spend 18 USDC on Scroll (destination chain) with the given liquidity fragmentation, it would typically require multiple clicks and steps for swapping or bridging different assets available on the source chains, so that user can convert the assets to the desired token balance on Scroll.

Through chain abstraction and ability to swap cross-chain, users have the convenience to view the consolidated token balance across supported tokens and chains. This simplifies the process of sending 18 USDC on Optimism, as users can sign the intent without the need for bridging, swapping, or considering the optimal routes.

The cross-chain swap enables users to:

- Spend assets on any destination chain without prior liquidity.
- Collate payable amount by combining multiple supported assets across source chains to address liquidity fragmentation.
