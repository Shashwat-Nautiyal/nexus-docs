# Avail node API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail node supports an extensive list of extrinsics and various other types of calls that you can
[try out in our explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/extrinsics).
2. This API reference currently documents only the most widely used extrinsics, but will be iterated upon
to eventually be an exhaustive resource for the Avail node API.

## Setting up the dev environment

<Tabs items={['avail-js', 'avail-deno', 'avail-rust', 'avail-go']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. Make sure `Node-js` is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd1"
node --version
```
If not installed, you can refer to [Node-js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for the same.

2. Create a new Node-js project by running the following command in a directory of your choice:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd2"
pnpm init
```

3. To install the `avail-js-sdk` run the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd3"
pnpm add avail-js-sdk@0.4.0
```

4. Make sure to install the `ts-node` package if you haven't already:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd4"
pnpm add -g ts-node
```

5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project by running:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd5"
touch tsconfig.json
```

6. Populate your `tsconfig.json` with the following configuration:

```json showLineNumbers filename="tsconfig.json" name="cmd6"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es2016",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "outDir": "build",
      "declaration": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      "strict": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true
    },
    "include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.js"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
} 
```

7. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by running:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd7"
pnpm add dotenv && touch .env
```

8. Put in the Seed Phrase of the account you want to use into the `.env` file:

```env showLineNumbers filename=".env" name="cmd8"
SEED="This is a random seed phrase please replace with your own"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ”¥">
**IMPORTANT**<br/>
1. Please be **VERY CAREFUL** with your seed phrase.
2. Make sure to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` so that it doesn't get pushed anywhere.
3. While it is good enough to use an `env` file while testing, try to use better practices while deploying to production.

<Callout type="warning">
**AVAIL-DENO HAS BEEN SUNSET**<br/>
1. The `avail-deno` SDK has been sunset and will not be maintained or upgraded in the future.

2. We recommend you switch to `avail-js`. The SDK will work with `deno` out of the box. \
Just run `deno run --allow-net your-file-name.ts` to run your `avail-js` code with `deno`.
</Callout>

1. Make sure `avail-deno` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Deno's docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/) for the same.

2. Create a new Deno JS project by running `deno init` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `your-file-name.ts`
in the project.

3. The examples in this reference will interact with the Turing testnet of Avail DA, and will use the correspponding endpoint.
You can use the [networks page](/docs/networks) to find endpoints for mainnet if you need to.

1. Make sure `rust` and cargo are installed on your system. You can refer to [Rustlang's docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Rust project by running:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd9"
cargo init
```

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml showLineNumbers filename="Cargo.toml" name="cmd10"
[workspace]

[package]
name = "your-project-name"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Use avail-rust v0.1.5 from the `avail-rust` repo
avail-rust = { git = "https://github.com/availproject/avail-rust", tag = "v0.1.5" }
# Tokio
tokio = { version = "1.38.0", features = ["full"] }
# dotenvy
dotenvy = "0.15.7"
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Check your rust version**<br/>
1. Run `rustc --version` to check the version of rust installed on your system.
2. Some features of the `avail-rust` SDK may not work with older versions of rust.
3. You can update the Rust version on your system by running `rustup update`.
</Callout>

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by running the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd11"
touch .env
```

5. Put in the Seed Phrase of the account you want to use into the `.env` file:

```env showLineNumbers filename=".env" name="cmd12"
SEED="This is a random seed phrase please replace with your own"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ”¥">

2. Create a new Go project by initializing a Go module in a directory of your choice. Run the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd14"
go mod init your-project-name
```

3. To install the avail-go-sdk, use the following command to add it to your project:

``` bash filename="terminal" name="cmd15"
go get github.com/availproject/avail-go-sdk@v0.2.3
```

4. To install the `godotenv` package, use the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" name="cmd16"
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
