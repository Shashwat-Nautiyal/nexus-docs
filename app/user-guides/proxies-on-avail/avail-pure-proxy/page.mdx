# Pure proxy accounts on Avail

<Callout>
We recommend going through the previous page on [proxy accounts](/user-guides/proxies-on-avail/avail-proxy) before proceeding with this guide.
</Callout>

The previous guide went over assigning ***existing*** accounts as proxies for your own account.
The following guide will teach you how to set up proxies that are not owned by anybody, but can still be used
to sign transactions on behalf of the proxied account.

The guide will have two parts:

- The first part will go over adding and removing a pure proxy for an account you own.
- The second part will go over setting up a qwqwqwqqqqwqwqwqw

## Create & remove a pure proxy for a single account

<Callout type="info">
The proxy types remain the same for a pure proxy, you can go over them again [in our docs here](/user-guides/proxies-on-avail/avail-proxy#proxy-types)
</Callout>

### Go to the Explorer

Head on over to the [accounts section of the Avail explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts) and connect your main account.
In my case, I start out with the highlighted account.

### Retrieve the pure proxy address

The address of the pure proxy generated by the `createPure` extrinsic is returned in the event logs of the block
that your transaction was included in.
We need to retrieve this address from the logs to be able to use the pure proxy. \
There are two ways to do this:

<Tabs items={['Using Avail Apps explorer', 'Using Subscan explorer']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
1. You will need the block number or block hash of the block that your transaction was included in.
2. Go to the [network explorer page](https://explorer.avail.so/#/network) and search for your block.
3. Scroll down to look for the event logs related to the `proxy.createPure` extrinsic.
4. Copy the address of the pure proxy from the event logs.

</p>

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
1. Go to the [subscan explorer](https://avail-turing.subscan.io/) and search for the address of your original account.
2. Scroll down and click on the transaction hash of your `createPure` transaction.

<br/>

4. Expand the event log and copy the address under the `pure` field.
