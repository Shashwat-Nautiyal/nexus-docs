# Manually submit an extrinsic to the network and wait for finalization

<Callout type="error">
**`author_submitAndWatchExtrinsic` IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE RIGHT NOW**<br/>

1. Avail builds on top of the [Polkadot SDK](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/#substrate) (formerly known as Substrate)
and implements most of it's underlying calls and extrinsics.
2. The `author_submitAndWatchExtrinsic` RPC call is known to be buggy and unreliable, and as such, not recommended for use.
3. We recommend most devs [use our dedicated SDKs](/api-reference/avail-node-api) instead of trying to use this RPC call directly.
4. You can read more about the problem in this Github issue: https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/issues/1668
5. Since the problem is upstream, we can't fix it directly.
6. We will keep this page updated with any new information :)
