# Avail

## Preface

***[<ins>The Future is Modular</ins>](https://blog.availproject.org/understanding-avail-modular-blockchains-through-metaphors/)***. However, the major L1 and L2 players, in their efforts to address scalability challenges, unintentionally recreated web2’s walled gardens. Interoperability modules are often patched onto existing architectures - instead of being designed from first principles. 
<br/>And lastly, crypto-economic security is shared unidirectionally - which makes bootstrapping an ecosystem hard.
The confluence of these friction points leads to a terrible web3 UX - with gas cost still spiking in the EVM ecosystem, painful cross-chain transaction flow, and weak crypto-economic security guarantees in smaller chains.

***Avail is buiding the unification layer for web3, solving fundamental Scaling and User Experience problems.***

## The Avail Trinity

Avail's ecosystem is designed to offer a superior experience for both users and developers, balancing the essentials of scalability, interoperability and security without compromise. The platform's structure is anchored in three primary layers:

1. **Data Availability (DA) Layer**: A foundational layer focused exclusively on DA, forming the basis for abundantly scalable modular chains. The DA layer is a highly optimized, low-level layer, specifically constructed for [<ins>data availability</ins>](https://blog.availproject.org/data-availability-what-is-it/).
This is the deepest blockchain layer, with the minimal functionality required to build <br/>
cross-ecosystem interoperability on top. <br/>
Avail DA uses validity proofs to make sure that devs don't have to trust Avail with anything, and KZG commitments to generate succint, fixed-size commitments for any data. 
2. **Nexus Layer**: Nexus is a light but powerful proof aggregation and sequencer selection zk rollup on top of Avail DA.<br/>
Avail Nexus acts as a permissionless verification hub that will unify rollups (not just those built within the Avail ecosystem), leveraging Avail DA as the root of trust. 
3. **Fusion Security Layer**: Enhances the overall security of the Avail network by pooling different tokens, including established tokens and emerging tokens.
Fusion will also help bring and lock more liquidity from other blockchains into the Avail ecosystem. <br/>
This approach will progressively bolster Avail's cryptoeconomic security and marks one of the first instances 
where foreign tokens like ETH and BTC are utilized to power consensus on a different blockchain.

These layers collectively aim to dissolve the market's fragmentation, providing a unified platform for users and developers from various ecosystems.

## Our vision

Avail is designed to address the challenges of the current blockchain ecosystem by providing a modular, scalable, and interoperable platform. <br/>
Avail's vision is to provide a cohesive, singular user experience within a flexible and modular blockchain ecosystem, drawing on lessons from Web2 
to innovate in Web3. Avail is not just building a product; we are pioneering a new category in the blockchain space, paving the way for an era of 
enhanced scalability and seamless integration.

- Avail aims to provide a cohesive platform that bridges the gaps between various blockchain ecosystems.
- By implementing the right primitives and standards, Avail seeks to ensure interoperability and cooperation among diverse blockchain networks. This approach not only enhances user experience but also fosters a more integrated and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

With Avail’s foundational DA layer, different ecosystems can innovate on top freely, while leveraging Nexus for cross-ecosystem messaging.
