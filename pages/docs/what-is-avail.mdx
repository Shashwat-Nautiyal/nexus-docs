# Avail

## Preface

***[<ins>The Future is Modular</ins>](https://blog.availproject.org/understanding-avail-modular-blockchains-through-metaphors/)***. However, the major L1 and L2 players, in their efforts to address scalability challenges, unintentionally recreated web2’s walled gardens. Interoperability modules are often patched onto existing architectures - instead of being designed from first principles. 
<br/>And lastly, crypto-economic security is shared unidirectionally - which makes bootstrapping an ecosystem hard.
The confluence of these friction points leads to a terrible web3 UX - with gas cost still spiking in the EVM ecosystem, painful cross-chain transaction flow, and weak crypto-economic security guarantees in smaller chains.

## Avail's solution

Avail leverages KZG commitments, proof aggregation, in-protocol sequencer selection, and shared security to unify the modular ecosystem. The Avail trinty consists of three layers:

1. **Data Availability (DA) Layer**: A foundational layer focused exclusively on DA, forming the basis for abundantly scalable modular chains. The DA layer is a highly optimized, low-level layer, specifically constructed for [<ins>data availability</ins>](https://blog.availproject.org/data-availability-what-is-it/).
This is the deepest blockchain layer, with the minimal functionality required to build <br/>
cross-ecosystem interoperability on top.
2. **Nexus Layer**: Nexus acts as a light but powerful proof aggregation and sequencer selection zk rollup on top of Avail DA, allowing for cross-rollup and cross-ecosystem settlement.
3. **Fusion Security Layer**: Enhances the overall security of the Avail network by pooling different tokens, including established tokens and emerging tokens.
Fusion will also help bring and lock more liquidity from other blockchains into the Avail ecosystem.

These layers collectively aim to dissolve the market's fragmentation, providing a unified platform for users and developers from various ecosystems.

## Our vision

Avail is designed to address the challenges of the current blockchain ecosystem by providing a modular, scalable, and interoperable platform.

- Avail aims to provide a cohesive platform that bridges the gaps between various blockchain ecosystems.
- By implementing the right primitives and standards, Avail seeks to ensure interoperability and cooperation among diverse blockchain networks. This approach not only enhances user experience but also fosters a more integrated and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

With Avail’s foundational DA layer, different ecosystems can innovate on top freely, while leveraging Nexus for cross-ecosystem messaging.
