# Avail Fusion

Avail Fusion is a the final step towards realising Avail's vision of a unified Web3 ecosystem.
Fusion will enable native assets from other major ecosystems like Bitcoin and Ethereum to be staked alongside Avail's native assets.
This will allow Avail to leverage existing mature assets to bolster its own cryptoeconomic security and marks one of the first 
instances where foreign tokens like ETH and BTC are utilized to power consensus on a different blockchain.

The first public prototype for Avail Fusion is still under development. We will keep you posted.<br/>
