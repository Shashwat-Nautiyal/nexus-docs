# Transaction finalities on Avail-powered rollups

Avail DA acts a decentralized blockchain network for rollups to use as a data availability layer. However Avail DA's job is to make the data
**'available'**, not to execute it.
This means that transactions submitted an Avail-powered rollup are subject to different degrees of finality.


<Steps>
### Soft confirmation
 
Centralised sequencer based rollups order the transactions and send soft confirmation to the user. 
Most users are satisfied because there is a negligible chance of reordering. 
Today, most rollups use this and explorers show this soft confirmation as transaction acceptance. 
 
### Subjective finality
 
As soon as the ordered batch hits Avail and the block is finalised by the Avail validator set, 
the batch is essentially final. Any rollup node can then execute the batch to know whether the 
xecution was done correctly, even if the proof of execution or fraud is not yet present.

### Objective finality

It is impractical to assume that users are going to rerun batches of transactions to determine whether the 
execution was done correctly. Hence, most rollup constructions rely on validity or fraud proofs which can
be efficiently verified by the user.

Once there is a validity proof which verifies a batch, the user can be assured of the correctness of 
execution by verifying it and hence getting objective finality. In optimistic constructions, only 
objective finality might be delayed because the user needs to wait for a challenge period, but with newer 
constructions where fraud proofs are also ZK proofs of incorrect transition, challenge periods can be 
further reduced.
