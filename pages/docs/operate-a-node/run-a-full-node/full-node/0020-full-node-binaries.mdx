# Running a Full Node with Binaries

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a full node for the Avail network using pre-compiled binaries. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced node operator, this guide aims to make the process straightforward.

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE YOU START<br/>
**Ensure that you meet the [<ins>system requirements</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-full-node/requirements).**
We recommend downloading the pre-compiled binary for speed and convenience.

## Option 1: Run the Pre-Built Release

All you need to do is run:

```bash
./data-avail -d ./data --chain goldberg --name MyAvailNode
```

Your node will also appear on the [<ins>Avail Telemetry</ins>](http://telemetry.avail.tools/) site, listed under the "Node name" from the node command output. Be sure to select the appropriate network tab at the top to view your node's status.

## Option 2: Build From Source

To compile the client source code, run the node:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/data-avail -d ./data --chain goldberg --name MyAvailNode
```
