# The Light Client Lift-off challenge

The Avail light client plays a crucial role in the Avail network by allowing anybody to verify the state
of the network with minimal resources.
The Avail light client challenge will run from 1st April 2024 to 8th April 2024. This guide serves
to outline all the instructions and T&C to participate in the challenge.

This challenge will be the last one as part of Avail's incentivized testnet program as we roll towards mainnet.
We have partnered with Blobscriptions for this challenge. You can visit the Avail website here to sign up for the challenge.

## What you will need

1. A substrate wallet you can use to sign transactions. 
For example: [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/) or [Subwallet](https://www.subwallet.app/).

2. Some `AVL` tokens if you don't have them. [You can use our faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/) to get some.

2. A computer with an internet connection.

And that's it.

Please note that the Avail light client was designed from the ground up to be an efficient piece of software
with minimal hardware requirements.
You don't need a powerful system at all to participate in the challenge, just something that works.

## How to participate

To participate in the challenge, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run the Avail light client on your local machine with this simple `curl` command:

```bash
curl -sL1 avail.sh | bash
```
<Callout type="info">
If this command does not work on your system, or you want to check out detailed instructions for
running the LC, you can check out our
[documentation](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-light-client/light-client-api-reference.mdx).
</Callout>

2. The light client will log a random address when it first initializes. Make sure to note down this address.
This is how it looks:

3. Once you have this address, go to the Light Client Lift-off challenge page and connect your substrate wallet. <br/>
A unique address pair consisting of your Substrate account and the light client address will be generated.
They should be unique and neither can be reused. The rewards for the challenge will be sent to the Substrate account address.
