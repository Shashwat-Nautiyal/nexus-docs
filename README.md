# Avail Overview

Avail aims to revolutionize the blockchain space by providing a trust-minimized and secure base layer focused on data availability. This base layer serves as the foundation for next-generation, trust-minimized applications and blockchains.

## The Evolution from Monolithic to Modular Blockchains

Traditional monolithic blockchains like Ethereum have faced scaling challenges due to handling multiple operations like Execution, Settlement, Ordering, and Data Availability on a single chain. Avail adopts a modular approach, separating these core operations into different layers for greater scalability and flexibility.

## The Avail Solution

Avail is a blockchain-based platform focused on creating a general-purpose data availability layer, addressing key challenges such as scalability, governance, and decentralization. By enabling technologies like Validiums and Sovereign Rollups, Avail allows for off-chain data availability, which significantly reduces costs and enhances efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Data Blob Indexing**: Avail simplifies data indexing by tying all transaction data to an application ID.
- **Erasure Encoding**: Adds redundancy to the data, making it harder for nodes to suppress information.
- **KZG Polynomial Commitments**: Ensures that the data has a footprint in the Avail block header.
- **Decentralized Network of Validators**: Avail aims to support up to 1,000 external validators to reduce centralization risks.
- **Validity Proofs**: Allows light clients to guarantee state correctness and data availability immediately after finalizing.

### Benefits for Validiums and Sovereign Rollups

- **Trust-Minimized Data Availability**: Avail provides a secure and decentralized solution for data availability.
- **Data Attestation Bridge**: Allows for attestation to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, proving that data is available.

## High Availability and Scalability

Avail's light client network ensures high data availability through Data Availability Sampling. As more light clients join the network, Avail can support bigger blocks, unlocking significant scaling potential for blockchains.

# Repository Overview

## Configuration Guide

### Static-Site Generator

The [Avail Developer Documentation](https://availproject.github.io/) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), making it easy to serve and host its static files.

### Deployments

The Avail Documentation is deployed across two distinct environments: **staging** and **prod**. Both are configured to operate from the `main` branch of the repository.

- **Staging**: Hosted on Digital Ocean, this environment serves as the testing ground for new changes. It allows for quality assurance and verification before updates are pushed to Production. You can view the staging site [here](https://docs-refresh-2-rjp2q.ondigitalocean.app/).

- **Production (Prod)**: This is the live environment, hosted on GitHub Pages, and is manually deployed by the Avail Documentation team. It is accessible to end-users and receives updates only after they have been successfully validated in the Staging environment.

### Algolia DocSearch

The documentation utilizes [Algolia's DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) to provide a powerful and user-friendly search experience. DocSearch is specifically designed to improve navigation in documentation websites, making it easier for users to find the information they need.

### Plausible Analytics

[Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) is integrated into the platform to monitor user interactions. This helps in understanding user engagement and behavior, thereby aiding in the continuous improvement of the documentation.

### Translations

| ‚ùó The documentation is currently undergoing reorganization and frequent updates in preparation for the Avail mainnet launch. Translation efforts will be prioritized once this is complete. |
