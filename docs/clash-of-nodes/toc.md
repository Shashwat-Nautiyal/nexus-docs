The following document shall be deemed to form the terms and conditions (the “General Terms”) for the Avail Testnet Incentive Programme between an “Eligible User” (as defined below) and Avail DIFC Limited (the “Company”), and be read and construed as part of the broader Avail Terms of Service (if any) in force from time to time (“Service Terms”), and shall be interpreted in the following order in case of discrepancy or ambiguity among the following documents;

1. Service Terms (if any)
2. General Terms

The Testnet Programme offers Eligible Users of access to the Testnet, designated and operated by the Company, including and on the basis of an intercompany agreement underlying the use of necessary IP rights owned within the Network Companies, the opportunity to earn Testnet Points, which may, at the discretion of the Company and in accordance with the Service Terms (if any), become convertible on the Conversion Date to Avail Tokens. These General Terms are supplemental to, and incorporate by reference, the Service Terms.
