## Objective

Avail is rapidly advancing towards Mainnet, and we are extending an invitation node operators to participate in the incentivized testnet program, Clash of Nodes. This program is a precursor to the Avail Mainnet, providing a hands-on experience with the base layer that's being optimized for a future powered by rollups.

### A Campaign for Everyone

The Clash of Nodes incentivized testnet is an opportunity for validators to engage with Avail's infrastructure in a simulated Mainnet environment. Participants will contribute to the network's resilience through a series of challenges, with the potential to earn rewards based on their performance and engagement.

Light clients are a testament to the decentralized nature of blockchain. They allow individuals to participate in the network without committing the resources typically required for a full node. With Avail, running a light client is designed to be straightforward, empowering anyone to contribute to the network's data availability and integrity.
