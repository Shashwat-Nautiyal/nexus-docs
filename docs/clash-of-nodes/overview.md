## Objective

Avail is rapidly advancing towards Mainnet readiness and we're calling on node operators to join the Clash of Nodes campaign. This campaign serves as the proving ground for the Avail network, offering participants a real-time look at the base layer that will underpin a new era of rollup-centric blockchain infrastructure.

### Who is Clash of Nodes For? A Campaign for Everyone

#### Validators

The Clash of Nodes incentivized testnet is an opportunity for validators to engage with Avail's infrastructure in a simulated Mainnet environment. Participants will contribute to the network's resilience through a series of challenges, with the potential to earn rewards based on their performance and engagement.

#### Light Clients

Join the Clash of Nodes by running a light client and take part in Avail's mission to build a scalable and interoperable blockchain infrastructure. Avail's light client functionality is uniquely designed to empower anyone, anywhere to participate in the network. With minimal resource requirements and a straightforward setup process, you can contribute significantly to the network's data availability and integrity, reinforcing Avail's commitment to a truly robust blockchain infrastructure.
