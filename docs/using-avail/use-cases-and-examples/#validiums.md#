# Avail-Powered Validiums

Due to the architecture of monolithic blockchains (such as Ethereum in
its current state), operating the blockchain is expensive, resulting
in high transaction fees. Rollups attempt to extract the burden of
execution by running transactions off-chain and then posting the
execution results and the [usually compressed] transaction data.

Validiums are the next step: instead of posting the transaction data,
it is kept available off-chain, where a proof/attestation is only
posted to the base layer. This is by far the most cost-effective
solution because both execution and data availability are kept
off-chain while still allowing for final verification and settlement
on the layer 1 chain.

Avail is a blockchain optimized for data availability. Any rollup that
wishes to become a validium can switch to post transaction data to
Avail instead of the layer 1 and deploy a verification contract that,
in addition to verifying the correct execution, also verifies data
availability.

The Avail team will make this data availability verification simple on
Ethereum by building an attestation bridge to post data availability
attestations directly to Ethereum. This will make the verification
contract's job a simple one, since the DA attestations will already be
on-chain. This bridge is currently in design; please reach out to the
Avail team for more information or to join our early access program.
