## Overview

Integrating with Avail enhances transaction processing by keeping data off-chain while ensuring its availability and validity. Avail's role as an optimized blockchain for data availability is central to this adaptation, offering a robust and modular design for diverse use cases.

### System Operations

- **Transaction Processing and Sequencing**: In the L2 framework, transactions are processed, sequenced, and readied for submission to Avail.
- **Data Submission to Avail**: This processed data is securely transferred to Avail, following a specific protocol designed for efficient and secure data handling.
- **Configuration and Connection**: L2 systems are configured for seamless integration with Avail, ensuring smooth data flow and interaction.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Users engage with on-chain contracts, providing Merkle proofs for actions like withdrawals. These contracts interact with Avail to authenticate and process these transactions.

### Attestation Bridge

Avail's Attestation Bridge is available on testnet for Ethereum.

- **Streamlined Verification with Attestation Bridge**: Avail's Attestation Bridge simplifies the verification process on L1. This bridge facilitates the direct posting of data availability attestations to the L1 blockchain, thereby easing the workload of the verification contract.
- **Role of the Verification Contract**: With the Attestation Bridge in place, the verification contract's primary role is to check these on-chain attestations, ensuring data availability and integrity.

### Interaction with L1

- **Verification Contract Functionality**: Situated on the L1, this contract plays a dual role—it verifies transaction accuracy and checks data availability, utilizing Avail's attestations.
- **L1 Contract Dynamics**: Validiums maintain a communicative relationship with Ethereum via dedicated contracts. The main attestation contract stores state commitments (Merkle data roots) from block producers. Parallelly, a verification contract handles state transition validity checks.

## Validium Architecture

In the Validium model, transactions are collected by a sequencer, which batches them together. The sequencer's role extends beyond transaction ordering—it prepares a Merkle tree of transactions, where each leaf represents a transaction or a set of transactions. The root of this Merkle tree, known as the batch hash, is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the transaction batch and for constructing inclusion proofs.

Avail comes into play as the recipient of this transaction data. Upon receiving the batched transactions, Avail executes erasure coding, a redundancy technique that spreads the transaction data across multiple nodes, ensuring that the complete set of data can be reconstructed even if some parts go missing. This is particularly important in a blockchain context to protect against data withholding attacks.

The inclusion proof is a Merkle proof generated by Avail to attest that a specific transaction is part of the batch and has been recorded on Avail’s blockchain. It’s essential for verifying the presence of transactions without downloading the entire dataset.

Simultaneously, the state of the system is computed by executing these transactions. The Prover, which is a computational entity, takes the state transitions and generates cryptographic proofs—such as zk-SNARKs or STARKs—to attest to the validity of state changes without revealing the underlying data.

The Sequence Sender is responsible for communicating with Ethereum. It takes the inclusion proofs and batch hashes from Avail, along with validity proofs from the Prover, and submits them to Ethereum. This submission process usually involves smart contract calls that log the transaction data's hash and the validity proofs onto Ethereum’s blockchain.

Ethereum acts as the ultimate layer for dispute resolution and finality. While it doesn’t store the transaction data itself, it retains the cryptographic commitments to the data. This ensures that if there's ever a dispute or need for verification, the proofs can be checked against the commitments to ascertain the validity of state transitions and the availability of data.

This setup leverages Ethereum's security while offloading the data-intensive work to Avail, which is optimized for handling vast amounts of data efficiently and securely. By doing so, Validium chains can significantly reduce their costs and improve scalability, all the while maintaining a high level of trust and security.
