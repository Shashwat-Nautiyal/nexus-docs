## Overview

Whether a Validium or Optimium, integrating with Avail enhances transaction processing by keeping data off-chain while ensuring its availability and validity. Avail's role as an optimized blockchain for data availability is central to this adaptation, offering a robust and modular design for diverse use cases.

### System Operations

- **Transaction Processing and Sequencing**: In the L2 framework, transactions are processed, sequenced, and readied for submission to Avail.
- **Data Submission to Avail**: This processed data is securely transferred to Avail, following a specific protocol designed for efficient and secure data handling.
- **Configuration and Connection**: L2 systems are configured for seamless integration with Avail, ensuring smooth data flow and interaction.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Users engage with on-chain contracts, providing Merkle proofs for actions like withdrawals. These contracts interact with Avail to authenticate and process these transactions.

### Attestation Bridge

:::note Available on testnet

Avail's Attestation Bridge is available on testnet for Ethereum.

:::

- **Streamlined Verification with Attestation Bridge**: Avail's Attestation Bridge simplifies the verification process on L1. This bridge facilitates the direct posting of data availability attestations to the L1 blockchain, thereby easing the workload of the verification contract.
- **Role of the Verification Contract**: With the Attestation Bridge in place, the verification contract's primary role is to check these on-chain attestations, ensuring data availability and integrity.

### Interaction with L1

- **Verification Contract Functionality**: Situated on the L1, this contract plays a dual roleâ€”it verifies transaction accuracy and checks data availability, utilizing Avail's attestations.
- **L1 Contract Dynamics**: Validiums maintain a communicative relationship with Ethereum via dedicated contracts. The main attestation contract stores state commitments (Merkle data roots) from block producers. Parallelly, a verification contract handles state transition validity checks.
