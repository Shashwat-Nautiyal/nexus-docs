Balance transfers are a method for transferring funds from one account to another. This guide will walk you through the process using Avail-JS UI. Before you begin, ensure you have [<ins>created an account</ins>](/about/accounts) and have [<ins>funds available</ins>](/about/faucet) for transfer.

## Transferring Funds Using Avail-JS

1. To withdraw test AVL and send funds from your account, select "Transfer" in the Accounts menu, or click the "Send" button on the Accounts page adjacent to the account you wish to send from.

2. Both options lead to a pop-up window where you can specify the recipient's account and the amount to be sent. If accessed via the "Send" button, the "Send from" account is pre-selected. For the recipient's account, choose from the drop-down menu, which includes your accounts and those in your Address Book, or paste an address directly. The recipient's account is not required to be in your Address Book.

3. After entering all necessary details, click on the "Make Transfer" button. This action opens a pop-up window displaying the expected transaction fees in milliAVL.

   > Understanding transaction costs in milliDOTs can be challenging. Here's a quick breakdown:
   >
   > - One milliDOT is equal to one-thousandth of 1 AVL.
   > - One divided by 1,000 equals 0.001.
   > - Therefore, one milliAVL is equivalent to 0.001 DOT.

4. When you are ready to execute your transaction, enter your password and click on the "Sign and Submit" button.
