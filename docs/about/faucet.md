You can use the Discord Faucet to get Avail (AVL) tokens on the Kate
testnet.

1. Make sure you have already [Created an account](/about/accounts.md) to receive funds.
2. Join the [Avail Discord](https://discord.gg/y6fHnxZQX8) and
   complete the verification step.
3. Navigate to the `#avail-faucet` channel and issue the following
   command: `/deposit <your address> `.

Your address will be deposited 1 AVL token once the status changes to
`Complete`.

:::note

The verification step is required, and you can only use the command
once every few minutes. The faucet is not meant for obtaining large
amounts of AVL (e.g. for validator bonding).
