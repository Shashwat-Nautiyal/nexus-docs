You can use the Discord Faucet to get Avail (AVL) tokens on the Goldberg testnet.

1. Make sure you have already [Created an account](/about/accounts.md) to receive funds.

2. Join the [Avail Discord](https://discord.gg/y6fHnxZQX8) and
   complete the verification step. You can confirm your verification status from the `#faucet-access-2` channel.

3. Navigate to the `#goldberg-faucet` channel and issue the following
   command: `/deposit <your address> `. This is what it should look like:

Your address will be deposited 5 AVL token once the status changes to
`Complete`. You may request AVL every 3 hours.

:::note Please note

- The `/deposit` command has a cool down period. You can use it only once every 3 hours.
- The faucet is designed to distribute small amounts of AVL for testing purposes, not large quantities for validator bonding or similar activities.
